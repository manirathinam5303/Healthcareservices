# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Healthcare Services Management App
This is a React app designed to manage a list of healthcare services, where users can add, update, and delete services. The app includes a navigation bar and a footer for better structure and user experience.

Features
Service List: Displays a list of healthcare services, with each service containing:

Name
Description
Price
Add New Service: Users can add new healthcare services through a form. Once submitted, the new service will appear in the list.

Update Service: Users can update the details (name, description, and price) of an existing service directly within the list.

Delete Service: Users can remove a service from the list by clicking the delete button.

State Management: State is managed using React hooks (useState and useEffect) to track the list of services.
